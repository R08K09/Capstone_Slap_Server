### **_1. Project Overview_**
As part of our capstone project, our team created an API and the UI for the app in 10 days. Our group decided to build on the nostalgic social media platform 'TheSlap.com' as seen on the show Victorious. The Slap is a modern social media platform reminiscent of MySpace, designed with the user in mind to share their thoughts and feelings with the world.
